Smart Civic Complaint Analyzer is an AI-based web application that allows citizens to report civic issues by simply uploading an image. The system automatically detects the type of issue, tags the location, and forwards the complaint to the appropriate municipal department. An admin dashboard tracks unresolved complaints, enabling faster resolution, better coordination, and improved transparency in civic governance.​
